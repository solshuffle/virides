### Crop Monitoring and Control

Virides is technology applied to facilitate the management of crops at home. With this system it is possible to cultivate your own garden at home without effort, in a simple way and facilitating a healthier life.

Virides is a device developed for the monitoring and control of home greenhouses up to 20m2. It is ideal for growing your own food at home. The system takes care of your crops automatically, providing the right amounts of water, temperature and ventilation so that the plants grow healthy. Everything is controlled over the Internet so that you can monitor and modify the parameters of the greenhouse.

### What does it do?

- Measures soil moisture and automatically controls irrigation according to the needs of each of the crops.
- Measures ambient temperature and humidity and activates ventilation and / or heating as required.

### How does it work?

The device has sensors for soil humidity, ambient temperature and humidity and drip irrigation devices, which allows efficient use of water and electrical energy. In addition, being connected to the Internet allows monitoring and control from the APP installed on any Tablet or Smartphone.

In this way, the data obtained in the measurements is accessed, and if necessary, the irrigation, ventilation and / or heating parameters can be modified.

The equipment is contained in a small watertight cabinet to which only the power supply, the sensors and actuators for irrigation (which have their own connection socket) and the ventilation and / or heating connections, should be connected, as configured. An installation manual is provided with all the indications and technical specifications.

The system is fully customizable. With minimal cost, and depending on the needs, sensing, irrigation, ventilation and / or heating elements can be added and / or removed, without the need to change equipment.
